This is a chatbot designed for replit.
The bot's keep alive program was forked from 
https://replit.com/@1nkFalcon

The original Jabebot file was written by https://github.com/Jman4190/gpt3-jabebot.
It's been modified since then but some of the original code is still there, though
mostly for formatting requests.

The model used is from AI21
